        <h3>How To Play</h3>
        <ul class="text-left">
            <li>Type <code>/gifoff</code> to start or continue a game in that channel (type at anytime if you need a hint)</li>
            <li>Click <code>Next Turn</code> to start a new round with a random prompter</li>
            <li>The prompter will get a <code>Choose Gif</code> button, or they can pass or nominate a different prompter. To choose, write a short prompt, and a gif that goes with it. Prompts should be neither too specific or too obscure, you want only <em>some</em> players to pick your gif out of the lineup. Some examples: "Help! The grocery store is out of quinoa!" / "logging on to twitter"</li>
            <li>Once the prompter has chosen, everyone else has 10 minutes to choose a gif from their own hand that also matches the prompt. Their goal is to trick the other players into thinking that their gif came from the prompter</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes, it's time to vote!</li>
            <li>Anyone who chose a gif should click <code>Vote</code> to see all the chosen gifs, and vote for which one they think came from the prompter</li>
            <li>Once the votes are in (or 10 minutes pass), all will be revealed, and the <em>very</em> important scores are tallied.</li>
            <ul>
            <li> If everyone voted for the prompters gif (it was too obvious!) or no one does (it was too obscure!) then everyone except the prompter gets <strong>2 points</strong></li>
            <li> Otherwise, the prompter & everyone who voted correctly gets <strong>3 points</strong></li>
            <li> As a bonus, everyone else gets <strong>1 point</strong> for each player they fooled with their gif</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Repeat ad nauseam </li>
        </ul>
